Welcome To The Game of Hangman!
 
The rules are simple. 
 
You are given either a word or a phrase depending on the difficulty level you choose, and you have to guess the word or phrase. Every time you guess a correct letter, it is inserted into the word, but if you guess a wrong letter, your hangman gets another limb building towards his full body. 
 
You can only guess 6 letters wrong, once your hangman is fully formed, you lose. You can guess the entire word at once, but BEWARE, if you get the word wrong you instantly loose. So chose wisely. 
 
To get the game up and running, simply open up your computer's terminal (command line) and enter the root directory of the hangman file. 
 
Once there, open the bin folder. You should see a file called run.rb, that's your Hangman game! (NOTE: This is a Ruby game, so you need to have Ruby before running it)
 
Once you are in the correct directory (hint: you can type pwd to see where you are holding in your terminal directory) simply type "ruby bin/run.rb" and walla, you should see the game start running in your command line.
